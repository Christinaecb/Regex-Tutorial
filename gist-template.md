# Regex Tutorial

Regex, short for regular expression, is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It is commonly used in programming and text processing to match and manipulate text based on specific rules or patterns. These expressions are extremely useful for extracting data like phone numbers, emails, etc that follow a specific pattern from text, and they can be used in almost any programming language including JavaScript. Regex is a powerful tool for text parsing and searching, allowing users to perform complex operations on large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. It is supported in many programming languages and text editors, and has a wide range of applications in web development, data analysis, and system administration.

## Summary

In this tutorial I will break down the following regex for matching an email /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/ into its basic components. This regex would be useful for validating email input in various applications.
